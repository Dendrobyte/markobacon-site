# Portfolio Site - Mark Bacon Back End

Welcome... TO THE Back END! \o/

**DEPRECATED?!**

Well, sort of. The back-end is written in Spring... which I'll upload here eventually? Everything that's here currently handles logging in and authentication, so for now we'll keep it. I'm going to need it until I transfer that stuff to Spring (which I fully intend to do).

## How Does it Work?

The back-end part of this site is a pretty generic react app (once again) but it's... well... the hidden dynamic stuff that static pages can't do. This repository is deployed to a service- which for now is Heroku and soon-to-be experimented with on Azure- and then run on there. The built static files then talk to that back-end that exists somewhere out in the universe.

Nice.
