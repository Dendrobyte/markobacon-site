# Portfolio Site - Mark Bacon Back End

Welcome... TO THE Back END! \o/

## How Does it Work?

The back-end part of this site is a pretty generic react app (once again) but it's... well... the hidden dynamic stuff that static pages can't do. This repository is deployed to a service- which for now is Heroku and soon-to-be experimented with on Azure- and then run on there. The built static files then talk to that back-end that exists somewhere out in the universe.

Nice.
